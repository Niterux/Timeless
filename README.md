# Timeless

Timeless is a mod that re-implements old bugs and features for people like me that don't like some changes.

## Features

Timeless includes:
- the old Create New World menu (this used to be [OldWorldMenu](https://github.com/RaderRMT/OldWorldMenu))
- a way to revert the hit direction fix ([video](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/904466942742655078/1096489592166809690/2023-04-14_19-37-27.mp4))

## Dependencies

This mod required Cloth Config and Fabric API. ModMenu is optional but highly recommended.
